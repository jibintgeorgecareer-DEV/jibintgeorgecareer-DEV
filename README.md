## Hi there 👋

I am a final-year Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student with strong skills in C++, PHP, and Python. My academic journey has been driven by a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), and I enjoy exploring how these technologies can solve real-world problems.
I love to build and create things, turning ideas into functional applications. So far, I have developed:
- 🖥️ Job Portal Website using PHP and XAMPP, designed to connect job seekers with employers.
- 📋 To-Do List Desktop Application built in C++, offering a simple and efficient way to manage daily tasks.
